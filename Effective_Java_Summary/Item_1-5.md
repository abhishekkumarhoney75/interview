# Item 1 to 5 Summary


# Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

#### A class can provide a public static factory method, which is simply a static method that returns an instance of the class. Hereâ€™s a simple example from Boolean (the boxed primitive class for boolean). This method translates a boolean primitive value into a Boolean object reference:


```java
public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b) {
       return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
}
```
